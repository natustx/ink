## Features

### Renders markdown the way it should look

Headings, bold, italic, strikethrough, links, blockquotes, lists, task lists, tables, footnotes, horizontal rules — all rendered with proper styling and colors.

### Syntax-highlighted code blocks

Language-aware highlighting for every major language. Code blocks get clean borders with the language label shown at the top.

### Inline images

Images in your markdown get rendered directly in the terminal using Unicode half-block characters. Works in any terminal with true color support. If an image can't load, ink shows a placeholder instead of crashing.

### Mermaid diagrams

Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, pie charts, and Gantt charts rendered as ASCII art. No external tools needed.

### GitHub-style admonitions

`[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`, and `[!CAUTION]` blocks render with distinct colors and icons.

### Wikilinks

`[[page]]` and `[[page|display text]]` syntax works out of the box. Great for browsing Obsidian vaults and personal wikis.

### File browser

Run `ink` with no arguments or point it at a directory. You'll get an interactive file picker that lists every `.md` file, with filtering and keyboard navigation.

### Multi-tab support

Open multiple files at once:

```bash
ink README.md CHANGELOG.md docs/guide.md
```

Switch between them with `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`.

### Search

Press `/` to search within a document. Matches highlight inline. Jump between results with arrow keys.

### Table of contents

Press `t` to toggle a sidebar showing every heading in the document. Tracks your position as you scroll.

### 8 built-in themes

Dark, Light, Dracula, Catppuccin, Nord, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, and Solarized. Press `T` to open the theme picker and preview each one live.

Auto-detects your terminal background and picks dark or light mode by default.

### Presentation mode

Split any markdown file into slides on `---` separators:

```bash
ink --slides deck.md
```

### Watch mode

Auto-reload when the file changes on disk:

```bash
ink --watch draft.md
```

### Document stats and outline

```bash
# Heading structure
ink outline README.md

# Word count, reading time, element counts
ink stats README.md

# Diff two markdown files
ink diff old.md new.md
```

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/ink/config.toml`:

```toml
# Default theme (dark, light, dracula, catppuccin, nord, tokyo-night, gruvbox, solarized)
theme = "catppuccin"

# Max rendering width in columns
width = 90

# Line spacing: compact, normal, relaxed
spacing = "normal"

# Show table of contents on startup
toc = false

# Show YAML/TOML frontmatter
frontmatter = false
```

### Custom themes

Drop a `.toml` file in `~/.config/ink/themes/` and use it by name:

```bash
ink --theme mytheme README.md
```

Every color is customizable — headings, code, links, blockquotes, admonitions, status bar, and more. Check any built-in theme in `src/theme/builtin.rs` for the full list of color keys.

## Shell integration

```bash
ink shell-setup bash   # or zsh, fish
```

Prints config snippets you can add to your shell profile — aliases, fzf preview, git pager setup.
